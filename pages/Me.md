I will be joining Amazon as an Applied Scientist II. In the long run, I am intrigued about pragmatics in user intent modeling, given my prior experience working briefly on moral inference. I look forward to seeing how this field evolves over the next decade. 


Before transitioning to this role, I spent five years researching the fundamental modeling capabilities on networks and downstream applications in search and recommendation. During this journey, two moments stand out as sources of profound inner fulfillment.

        <strong>Pioneering Graph Foundation Models (GFMs)

        GFM is a naive yet intriguing research topic that intersects network science, geometry, and neural-symbolic reasoning, providing a complementary perspective to the existing foundation model paradigm. GFMs may hold future potential for applications in code graphs, scene graphs, and higher-level intelligence, such as analogical reasoning. <br>

        <strong>Serving as the organizer of the [<a href="https://logconference.org/">Learning on Graph Conference 2024/25</a>]</strong> <br>
        LoG is an exciting new conference facilitating graph and geometry community engagement. Being part of this initiative is exciting.
