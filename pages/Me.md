I am an applied scientist in Kiro Science. Post-train and orchestrate LLM agents for industrial-scale code repositories, with a focus on enabling models to continue learning from agent trajectory and support entereprise modernization workflows (e.g., VMware and .NET migration). I feel very fortunately working with Luka Huan. Keywords: post-train, LLM agent, code graph reasoning, software engineering automation, experiment-driven learning, small–large model collaboration, industrial code migration.

Before transitioning to industry role, I spent five years researching the fundamental modeling capabilities on networks. During this journey, two moments stand out as sources of profound inner fulfillment.

        <strong>Pioneering Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) 
        [<a href="https://dive.google.com/file/d/1DycBQkBdTCmZOWh9WHNo6gNrALHmDLfe/view?usp=sharing">Research Statement</a>]

        GFM is a naive yet intriguing research topic that intersects network science, geometry, and neural-symbolic reasoning, providing a complementary perspective to the existing foundation model paradigm. GFMs may hold future potential for applications in code graphs, scene graphs, and higher-level intelligence, such as analogical reasoning. <br>

        <strong>Serving as the organizer of the [<a href="https://logconference.org/">Learning on Graph Conference 2024/25</a>]</strong> <br>
        LoG is an exciting new conference facilitating graph and geometry community engagement. Being part of this initiative is exciting.
